# :mag_right: Background 
Open WebUI is an extensible, self-hosted interface for AI that adapts to your workflow, all while operating entirely offline.
 
# :bug: Vulnerability Detail 
The application does not verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly call the `/api/v1/prompts/` interface to retrieve all prompt information created by the admin, which includes the `ID` values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit the `/api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id}` interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information.
 
# :bulb: Workaround 
Upgrade to the latest Open WebUI version.
 
## :whale: How to test for the vulnerability using Docker?

```
docker compose --file docker-compose-cve-2024-7045.yml up
```
