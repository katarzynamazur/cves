# :mag_right: Background
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that restricts resources being fetched from a different origin (i.e., domain, protocol, or port) that the origin from which the resource was requested. When a web browser makes a request to a server, the server includes information in the response header indicating which origins are allowed to access the resource. If the origin of the request is not in the list of the allowed origins, the browser blocks the response and displays an error message.

Flask-Cors is a popular library that makes it easy to configure CORS in a Flask API. 

# :bug: Vulnerability Detail
corydolphin/flask-cors in version 4.0.0 is vulnerable to log injection when the log level is set to debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by sending a specially crafted GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the request path. This vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt log files, potentially covering tracks of other attacks, confusing log post-processing tools, and forging log entries. The issue is due to improper output neutralization for logs.

# :bulb: Workaround
There is no known workaround for this vulnerability. It is essential to update to the latest version of Flask-Cors to address the issue.
