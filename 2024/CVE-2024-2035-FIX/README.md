# :mag_right: Background
ZenML is a MLOps framework intended for data scientists or ML engineers looking to standardize machine learning practices.

# :bug: Vulnerability Detail
An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the zenml-io/zenml repository, specifically within the API PUT `/api/v1/users/id` endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to modify the information of other users, including changing the `active` status of user accounts to false, effectively deactivating them. This issue affects version `0.55.3` and was fixed in version `0.56.2`. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it allows for the deactivation of admin accounts, potentially disrupting the functionality and security of the application.

# :bulb: Workaround
Upgrade to the latest zenml-io/zenml version.
 
## :whale: How to test for the vulnerability using Docker?
Using the same code as in CVE-2024-2035 should no longer work, because this version consists a fix for CVE-2024-2035 vulnerability.

```
docker run -p 2035:8080 mazurkatarzyna/cve-2024-2035-fix
```
