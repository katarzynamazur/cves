# :mag_right: Background
ZenML is a MLOps framework intended for data scientists or ML engineers looking to standardize machine learning practices.

# :bug: Vulnerability Detail
A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version `0.56.3` allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically, the session does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.

# :bulb: Workaround
Upgrade to the latest zenml-io/zenml version.
 
## :whale: How to test for the vulnerability using Docker?

```
docker run -dp 4680:8080 docker.io/mazurkatarzyna/cve-2024-4680:latest
```
