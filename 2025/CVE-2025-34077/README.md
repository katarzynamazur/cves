# :mag_right: Background
WordPress is a popular, free, and open-source software called a content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites without needing to know how to code. It provides a user-friendly dashboard to build and publish content, and can be customized with various themes and plugins to add functionality, making it suitable for everything from personal blogs to e-commerce stores. 

# :bug: Vulnerability Detail
An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the WordPress Pie Register plugin ≤ 3.7.1.4 that allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint. By setting social_site=true and manipulating the user\_id\_social\_site parameter, an attacker can generate a valid WordPress session cookie for any user ID, including administrators. Once authenticated, the attacker may exploit plugin upload functionality to install a malicious plugin containing arbitrary PHP code, resulting in remote code execution on the underlying server.
 
# :bulb: Workaround
Upgrade Pie Register plugin to the newest version.
