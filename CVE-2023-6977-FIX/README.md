# Background
MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

# Vulnerability Detail
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read due to a bypass of the fix for CVE-2023-2780. This allows attackers to trick the `is_local_uri()` function into downloading arbitrary files unrelated to MLflow from the host server, including any files stored in remote locations to which the host server has access.

# Workaround
Upgrade MLflow to version 2.10.0 or higher.

## How to run Dockerfile to test for the vulnerability?

Using the same code as in CVE-2023-6977 should no longer work, because this version consists a fix for CVE-2023-6977 vulnerability. 

```
docker run -p 5002:5002 mazurkatarzyna/cve-2023-6977-fix:latest
```
