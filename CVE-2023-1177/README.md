# Background
MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

# Vulnerability Detail
Path Traversal: `'\..\filename'` in GitHub repository mlflow/mlflow prior to `2.2.1`.  A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with `"dot-dot-slash (../)"` sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files. Reading arbitrary sensitive files on the server. Additionally, reading arbitrary files on the remote artifact store server. Because MLflow is most often configured to use an S3 bucket (per research on publicly available MLflow instances found via Shodan) this means AWS account credentials can also be stolen in the majority of deployments. System takeover and RCE is possible via stealing the private SSH keys from the server. 

# Workaround
Upgrade mlflow to version 2.2.1 or higher. 


## How to test for the vulnerability using Docker?
```
docker run -p 5001:5001 -p 2022:22 mazurkatarzyna/cve-2023-1177:latest
